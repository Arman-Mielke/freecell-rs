# Card Codes

Each card can be described using a card code, a string of two characters.
The first character denotes the card's rank:
- 'A' or '1' -> Ace
- '2' -> 2
- ...
- '9' -> 9
- 'T' -> 10
- 'J' -> Jack
- 'Q' -> Queen
- 'K' -> King

The second character denotes the suit:
- 'C' -> Club
- 'S' -> Spade
- 'H' -> Heart
- 'D' -> Diamond

card codes are case-insensitive.
